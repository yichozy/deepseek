# Go-Deepseek

Go-deepseek is a Go client for the [DeepSeek API](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/); supporting DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, and more, with both streaming and non-streaming options. This **production-ready** client is actively maintained, with ongoing bug fixes and feature enhancements.

## Install

```
go get github.com/yichozy/deepseek
```

## Usage

![go-deepseek-flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfa6fc98-65f2-4a08-ab13-8c0732ac8302)

Here’s an example of sending a "Hello Deepseek!" message using `model=deepseek-chat` (**DeepSeek-V3 model**) and `stream=false`

```
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/yichozy/deepseek"
	"github.com/yichozy/deepseek/request"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := deepseek.NewClient("your_deepseek_api_token")

	chatReq := &request.ChatCompletionsRequest{
		Model:  deepseek.DEEPSEEK_CHAT_MODEL,
		Stream: false,
		Messages: []*request.Message{
			{
				Role:    "user",
				Content: "Hello Deepseek!", // set your input message
			},
		},
	}

	chatResp, err := client.CallChatCompletionsChat(context.Background(), chatReq)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error =>", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("output => %s\n", chatResp.Choices[0].Message.Content)
}
```

Try above example:

```
First, copy above code in `main.go`
Replace `your_deepseek_api_token` with valid api token

$ go mod init
$ go get github.com/yichozy/deepseek

$ go run main.go
output => Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊
```

## Why yet another Go client?

We were looking for `Dedicated` & `Simple` Go Client for Deepseek API but we didn't find it so we built this one 😃

## What's special about this Go client?

- **Simple** – Below is the Go package structure with all exported entities. It is as simple as possible. Also, it's Go's idiomatic way - request is under request pkg, response is under response.

![go_pkg_structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/729a2294-98fa-4f6e-b936-ae5eb1b624ff)

- **Complete** – It offers full support for all APIs, including their complete request and response payloads. (Note: Beta feature support coming soon.)

- **Reliable** – We have implemented numerous Go tests to ensure that all features work correctly at all times.

- **Performant** – Speed is crucial when working with AI models. We have optimized this client to deliver the fastest possible performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We know that sometimes **Deepseek API is down** but we won't let you down.
>
> We have **`Fake Client`** using which you can continue your development and testing even though Deepseek API is down.
>
> Use `fake.NewFakeCallbackClient(fake.Callbacks{})` / See example [`examples/81-fake-callback-client/main_test.go`](examples/81-fake-callback-client/main_test.go)
